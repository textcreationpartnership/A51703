            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Heb. 9.27. compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with <hi>Job</hi> 5.4.—<hi>Cap.</hi> 19.28.) (5) that <hi>there is an Heaven, and an Hell; an eternity of happineſs, and an eternity of miſery after this life, to one of which places and ſtates all ſhall be adjudged:</hi> (Matth. 25.34, 41.) <hi>To which eternity would you be adjudged?</hi> Would you have the <hi>eternal love</hi> of God, or the <hi>eternal wrath</hi> of God, for your <hi>portion</hi> in the other world?

And is not that holy life called for in the Text, under theſe expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>See that ye walk circumſpectly, &amp;c?</hi> Is not this evident both in that the Apoſtle, before he lays down the Exhortation in the Text, premiſeth, <hi>verſe</hi> 6. that <hi>the wrath of God will come upon all the children of diſobedience,</hi> i. e. upon all that will not be perſwaded to hearken to the (and therefore to this) Word of God?

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:61700:10"/>backs this Exhortation in the Text from the folly of not living ſo holy a life, as he therein exhorts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; Doth not he clearly imply (if not expreſly aſſert) that there is no other way to ſecure the everlaſting happineſs of the other world?</p>
                  <p>Queſt. 5. <hi>Will you give it under your hands that you do verily believe, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs you ſee to it, that you live as holy a life as you are exhorted to in the Text, you ſhall have no inheritance in the Kingdom of God and of Chriſt; but the wrath of God will come upon you for your folly and madneſs in neglecting your main inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt?</hi> If you indeed believe thus, I have but one queſtion more to ask you, before I ſhew you what an holy life is called for from you in the Text.</p>

Be not afraid that I would engage you to live a holier life then the Apoſtle calls for in the Text: If it be not demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted even to your own conſciences, that all the following particulars are ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally inferr'd from the Apoſtles words, your promiſe doth not bind you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.

Though there be <hi>many ſeekers,</hi> yet there are but <hi>few ſtrivers</hi> to walk in the narrow way that leads to life, (<hi>Mat.</hi> 7.13, 14.) But this is no diſcouragement. You ſhall not <hi>want company</hi> in the <hi>way</hi> to <hi>heaven,</hi> no, not <hi>good</hi> company, (<hi>Prov.</hi> 12.10.) nor find <hi>comfort</hi> in your company in the <hi>way</hi> to <hi>hell.</hi> If you would indeed have the number of holy livers to be greater, why do not you <hi>increaſe</hi> it by joyning with them? Though Chriſts flock be very little, yet all that be of his flock, do live this holy life. Doth not the Apoſtle tell you, <hi>By this we know, that we love the children of God, when we love God, and keep his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments; for this is the love of God</hi> (herein it conſiſts, hereby it is eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced) <hi>that we keep his commandments, and his Commandments are not grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous?</hi> (1 <hi>John</hi> 5.2, 3.)

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:61700:19"/>that it is <hi>eaſie</hi> and <hi>pleaſant</hi> to them to live ſo holy a life? If you ſay you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not however live thus; I ask you, how do you know? Did you ever try what might be done in this caſe? Did you ever ſet in good earneſt about it? Have you not only <hi>ſought,</hi> but <hi>ſtrove</hi> to walk in this narrow way? If you have not, you have dreadfully mocked God, in pretending that it is impoſſible for you to live ſo holy a life.

                  <p>Motive 1. <hi>Hereby one great hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of living this life is removed out of your ſouls:</hi> and that is <hi>ignorance</hi> and <hi>blindneſs. Ignorant</hi> ſouls are indeed <hi>alienated from the life of God,</hi> (Eph. 4.18.)
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:61700:22"/>they cannot endure to live <hi>ſuch a life as God lives,</hi> or <hi>as he commands them to live:</hi> they cannot endure to be <hi>holy as God is holy,</hi> or as he calls them to be holy, <hi>viz. to be holy in all manner of converſation.</hi> But will you alſo be alienated, thus <hi>alienated from the life of God?</hi> Shall your <hi>alienation</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, though your <hi>ignorance</hi> doth not continue?</p>
                  <p>Motive 2. <hi>Hereby you are more than others obliged to live this life.</hi> Others are indeed bound to live this life, though they do not know it to be their duty; but you much more, ſeeing you <hi>know</hi> the <hi>nature, neceſsity,</hi> and <hi>excellency</hi> of this life, and that not only <hi>notiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> but <hi>intuitively</hi> and <hi>experimentally.</hi> Your very <hi>knowledge</hi> is an <hi>obligation</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you: you are bound not only by <hi>the law without,</hi> but by <hi>the law within</hi> you: you are <hi>bound in</hi> your <hi>ſpirits,</hi> (<hi>Acts</hi> 20.22) your light doth lovingly <hi>conſtrain</hi> you, (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14) <hi>neceſsity is laid upon you</hi> thereby (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.16.) and you can do no other (unleſs you will offer vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence

Yet you ſee that it is very reaſonable, that you ſhould be the more careful to live this holy life, <hi>becauſe the days are evil:</hi> Both <hi>becauſe the cuſtoms and manners of moſt are ſo wicked, that they have even tainted time it ſelf, and corrupted the very days:</hi> And <hi>becauſe the days are very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, by reaſon of temptation and perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> That ſo the <hi>times</hi> may be <hi>bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered</hi> by your means; and that <hi>you</hi> your ſelves may be <hi>ſecured</hi> from the <hi>dangers</hi> and <hi>ſnares</hi> thereof: and that you, <hi>hearts</hi> may be <hi>born up</hi> under the <hi>perſecution</hi> you meet with therein. <hi>See therefore that ye walk circumſpectly, not as fools, but as wiſe, redeeming the time, becauſe the days are evil.</hi> (2) <hi>Your light cannot but be urging what you know to be your duty upon your conſcience.</hi> It cannot but be putting you upon doing
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:61700:24"/>what you ought; it cannot but be a <hi>ſpur</hi> in your ſides to make you <hi>go,</hi> yea <hi>run</hi> the wayes of Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments.

Thus here, <hi>Ye are light in the Lord, i. e.</hi> ye are not only <hi>enlightned,</hi> but <hi>enliven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> made partakers of a double life, the life of <hi>juſtification,</hi> and the life of <hi>ſanctification; See then that ye walk circumſpectly,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>You are made partakers of the life of righteouſneſs:</hi> In Scripture, <hi>life</hi> and <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> are taken for the ſame, (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6, 7, 9. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.17, 21.) Becauſe ſin, by reaſon of its guilt, doth immediately make a man <hi>dead in law,</hi> (<hi>John</hi> 3.18.) And when a <hi>capital</hi> offender is <hi>pardoned,</hi> we ſay, <hi>his life is given him.</hi> Thus are you made alive: in your juſtification
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:61700:26"/>the ſentence of <hi>condemnation</hi> is rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, (<hi>John</hi> 3.18.) you enjoy <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>reconciliation</hi> with God, and his <hi>love</hi> and <hi>favour,</hi> (<hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1.) And in Scripture, <hi>light,</hi> upon the account of its <hi>diffuſiveneſs</hi> and <hi>communicative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> and <hi>comfortableneſs,</hi> ſignifies ſometimes <hi>peace;</hi> ſometimes <hi>love</hi> and <hi>favour.

And good reaſon there is, why you ſhould, even upon the account of the pardon of your ſins, and the juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your perſons: For,</p>
                  <p>Motive 1. <hi>Hereby another great hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance of your living this life is remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;</hi> and that is <hi>guilt;</hi> Sins binding over the Soul to the wrath of God. No wonder that others do not live this life, which is <hi>a walking with God,</hi> (Gen. 5.24.) <hi>Can two walk together,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:61700:27"/>except they be agreed?</hi> (Amos 3.3.) No wonder that they <hi>fly from God</hi> (ſo our firſt Parents did, (<hi>Gen.</hi> 3.8, 10.) as an enemy: So he is to their ſouls, and they are <hi>children of his wrath,</hi> (Epheſ. 2.3.) But your guilt is taken away, and God of an <hi>enemy</hi> is become your <hi>friend,</hi> (<hi>Col.</hi> 1.20, 21, 22.) You can indeed find <hi>no pleaſure</hi> in the <hi>company</hi> of an <hi>enemy;</hi> and if an <hi>enemy employ</hi> you about any thing, you will <hi>not go</hi> about it if you can chooſe; and if you do, you go about it <hi>grudgingly:</hi> But what! Will not you walk with your <hi>beſt friend?</hi> Shall it not be the delight of your ſouls to be employed by him?</p>
                  <p>Motive 2. <hi>You are upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count more bound to live this life, then others are:</hi> For (1) <hi>The way of your juſtification doth ſtrongly bind you here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto;</hi> for this holy life is the end of juſtification by faith; and therefore this way of Juſtification is appointed to continue onely till you are brought to live perfectly holy lives in Heaven;
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:61700:27"/>for then there will be another way for your acceptation, though the glory and honour of all will be given to Chriſt. (2) <hi>Your diſcharge from the Covenant of Works in your Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, doth alſo ſtrongly bind you hereunto.</hi> When you are juſtified, you are not bound to a <hi>perſonal, perfect,</hi> and <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual</hi> keeping of the Law, as the <hi>condition</hi> of life, (<hi>Gal.</hi> 4.21, 22.) But, yea therefore, you are bound to be the more careful ſincerely to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Law, as a <hi>Rule</hi> of life. So long as you were under the Covenant of Works, you might indeeed be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged from endeavouring to obey the Law, becauſe that Covenant ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepteth of nothing but <hi>perfect</hi> obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, (<hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10.) <hi>gives no power</hi> at all to obey, and therefore called <hi>the Letter,</hi> (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6.) yea <hi>cauſeth</hi> acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally the <hi>abounding</hi> of diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, (<hi>Rom.</hi> 5.10.) and therefore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to an <hi>husband,</hi> and a ſinful heart to a <hi>wife,</hi> (<hi>Rom.</hi> 7.4, 5.) But now being under the Covenant of Grace, God is
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:61700:28"/>engaged to <hi>forgive</hi> your <hi>tranſgreſsions,</hi> (Jer. 31.34.) and to <hi>accept</hi> your <hi>imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi> obedience: (<hi>Mal.</hi> 3.17.) yea, to <hi>give</hi> you <hi>power</hi> and ſtrength to <hi>do</hi> what is <hi>required,</hi> and to <hi>abſtain</hi> from what is forbidden, (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6. <hi>Mica.</hi> 7.19.) O! What an obligation is this upon you, to ſee to circumſpect walking? Verily, Gods promiſing in the Covenant of Grace to enable you to walk in his Statutes, doth not ſhut out your endeavour, but engage you to endeavour; for God only promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to help you, if you endeavour in the uſe of the means, (whereof Prayer is one,) (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.27. compared with <hi>Verſe</hi> 37.) (3) <hi>The grace of God in your juſtification bindeth you hereunto,</hi> (Tit. 2.11, 12. Rom. 6.12, 13, 14.) Hereby God hath done more for you then others; and therefore you ſhould do more for him then others, (<hi>Matth.</hi> 5.47.) <hi>Conſidering how great things he hath done for you,</hi> (1 Sam. 12.24.) (4) <hi>Your relations, upon your Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, bind you hereunto:</hi> Being ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:61700:28"/>you are Chriſts and Gods, and therefore ſhould ſee to it that you live to God and Chriſt, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.20.) O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are not under your bonds: they may indeed be more under the bond of <hi>ſlaviſh fear;</hi> but you are more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the bond of <hi>love,</hi> and the bond of <hi>love</hi> is ſtronger then that of <hi>fear.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Motive 3. <hi>You have upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count more encouragements then others, to live this life:</hi> For, (1) <hi>There are ſome motives more cogent upon you, then upon others;</hi> To inſtance onely in two: That <hi>the grace of God teacheth ſouls to deny all ungodlineſs and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly luſts, and to live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly,</hi> (Tit. 2.11, 12.) And that <hi>not to live this life, is to turn the grace of God into wantonneſs,</hi> (Jude 4.) can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but have greater influence upon your ſouls, then upon others. (2) <hi>You are more aſſured of help to live this life then others,</hi> and that upon a double account; Both becauſe the more a man doth forſake any thing of his own for Chriſt, the more Chriſt is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:61700:29"/>to give of his good things to that man: And therefore ſeeing when you become juſtified by faith, you lay down all your own righteouſneſs, Chriſt is engaged to give you his righteouſneſs, that righteouſneſs which he worketh in ſouls: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, upon your believing for Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, you are eſtated in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, and ſo God is engaged to enable you to live this holy life, as you heard under the former particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.</p>
                  <p>Motive 4. <hi>If you will not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to follow this exhortation, your ſin is, upon this account, greater then the ſin of others:</hi> For, (1) <hi>Hereby you croſs Gods grand deſign, in his decree of election, in his ſending his Son into the World, in Juſtification, in all his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances and Providences, more then others.</hi> What ever others are, if you be indeed juſtified, you are <hi>predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to live this life,</hi> (Rom. 8.29, 30.) <hi>Chriſt came,</hi> not only <hi>to redeem</hi> you from the <hi>guilt</hi> of all iniquity; but <hi>to
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:61700:29"/>purifie</hi> you from the <hi>filth</hi> of ſin, and <hi>to make you peculiar people to himſelf, zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of good works,</hi> (Tit. 2.14.) In your Juſtification <hi>you are therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered out of the hands of all your ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, that you might ſerve God without fear, in holineſs and righteouſneſs before him all your days:</hi> (Luke 1.74, 75.) The deſign of God in all his <hi>Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> and <hi>Providences</hi> is your <hi>good,</hi> that you may live better and better, (<hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28.) And what! Is it nothing to you, even to you, to croſs Gods grand deſign in the World? (2) <hi>Hereby you gratifie the Devil more then others:</hi> Though he is againſt holineſs in any; yet he is not ſo much rejoyced that others will not live this holy life, as he is, if he can but perſwade a Juſtified perſon to be unwilling thereunto; and that appears in his rage againſt ſuch as will not be perſwaded by him: he will by ſome means or other ſtir up ſharp Perſecution againſt them, (2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.12.) (3) <hi>Hereby you turn the grace of God into wantonneſs, more then others,</hi>
                     <pb n="48" facs="tcp:61700:30"/>(<hi>Jude</hi> 4.) Others turn the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of Free-grace in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>uſtification into wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſs; but you turn the <hi>Grace</hi> of Juſtification it ſelf into wantonneſs: and therefore your ſin is againſt more mercy, and by conſequence doth more grieve the Spirit then others unperſwadableneſs. (4) <hi>Hereby your unperſwadableneſs becomes more inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable.</hi> It is not indeed <hi>unpardona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;</hi> for <hi>you are not under the Law, but under Grace;</hi> (Rom. 6.14.) But yet it is altogether <hi>unexcuſable,</hi> even <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you are under Grace;</hi> and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, if you would be perſwaded to ſet upon living this life, you ſhould find God coming in to your help, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Promiſe in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace.</p>
                  <p>Motive 5. <hi>If you will not be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to live this holy life, you cannot have aſſurance that you are indeed juſtified:</hi> And is that nothing to you? <hi>yea, you cannot but conclude, that you are miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in thinking that you are juſtified:</hi> Are not the Apoſtles words plain?

Would you not be glad to be aſſured that you are converted, and truly gracious? Are not all Gods Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to godlineſs exceeding great and precious in your eye? And would you not rejoyce, to be aſſured, that they do all belong to you? Would you not live comfortably in the ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt dayes? And would you not be aſſured that you ſhall die comfortably, and give up you account with joy? <hi>See then that you walk thus circumſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> (1 Tim. 4.8. 2 Cor. 1.12. 2 Kings 20.3.

               <p>Is it not evident from the former hints, that this holy life is rational, more expected from you, then from others? Are not more eyes upon you then upon others? Do not the eyes
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:61700:34"/>of <hi>Devils, infernal</hi> and <hi>incarnate,</hi> watch more for your haltings, then for the haltings of others? Are not the eyes of <hi>God, Angels</hi> and <hi>Saints,</hi> moſtly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you, looking that you ſhould walk worthy of your ſtate and profeſſion? Are not <hi>wiſe actions</hi> rationally <hi>more</hi> expected from <hi>wiſe men,</hi> then from <hi>fools?</hi> (<hi>James</hi> 3.13.) You are through grace made <hi>wiſe unto ſalvation:</hi> others are left in their natural folly, and mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: <hi>See then that ye walk circumſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, not as fools, but as wiſe,</hi> &amp;c. What! Will you, even you, <hi>deceive</hi> all the <hi>expectations</hi> of <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Angels,</hi> yea of <hi>God</hi> himſelf? Doth not God himſelf make his boaſt of you? <hi>Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they are my people, children that will not lie,</hi> (Iſa. 63.8.) i.e. they will not deal perfidiouſly with me, (<hi>Gen.</hi> 21.23. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44.17. <hi>Hab.</hi> 3.17.) At your firſt believing you have covenanted with God, that you would never more live a worldly, ſenſual life, and that you would make it your main buſineſs, to live this holy and ſtrict life: And
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:61700:34"/>will you break Covenant with God? VVill you thus be found liars? Shall God, even your God, be made aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of his boaſt of you? <hi>God forbid.</hi> But ſo much concerning this Text, as <hi>A Serious Exhortation</hi> to <hi>Sinners</hi> and <hi>Saints,</hi> to live an holy life here, as ever they would avoid eternal death, and enjoy eternal life, hereafter.</p>
